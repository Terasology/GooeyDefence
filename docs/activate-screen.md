# `ActivateScreen`

The `ActivateScreen` is a user interface element that is displayed at game start-up after the loading screen is closed.
It consists a welcome title, some informational text, and a button labeled "Begin".
Closing the screen via the "Begin" button or pressing `Esc` will activate the field and cause the game to start or resume.

The informational text displayed varies depending on whether the world is newly created or loaded from a save.
While this is not implemented currently, the idea is to show statistics, flavour text, and possibly allow for configuring the game.
